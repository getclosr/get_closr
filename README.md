# Get Closr

After much studying of other companion apps for smart jewellery wearables, Closr's app is decidedly needing more features.

While maintaining the need for BLE connection capabilities, Get Closr's main aim is now different. Previously where sending a touch is all that matters, now the focus is on when (and where) to send a touch. A touch can be very powerful when administered at the right time and if in need, but unwelcomed and annoying when not well-received. 

Get Closr aims to use ML to predict based on user's usage data over 2-4 weeks to recommend to both parties when is a good time to send a touch. 

Less is more. 

We believe in the fleeting thoughts that our loved ones emerge in our (sub)consciousness, these thoughts should be conveyed for people important to you should know if they have been on your mind, even for a fleeting moment. 

These moments may very likely not be enough to be made into a sentence, but more often than not these small thoughts, and their real life manifests - a poke, a glance, a brush on the back, are what keeps the receiver on their tippy edge, that gives them the feeling of being close, being in love the first time, being intimate. 

Modern life is hectic, busy and distracted, human interaction have been digitized for availability and convenience, but not for intimacy. We'd think that the increased availability and convenience will mean increased intimacy, yes, maybe for corporations and customers, but not necessarily the case for your average couple. 

## Closr

Closr started out with the vision of bringing people closer with technology, enabling people to be intimate even though they are apart. Closr is the vanilla version of a bluetooth enabled vibrator, Closr is targetting the emotional part of the relationship. 

It is a difficult and elusive idea to capture and we have been trying very hard to create something that embodies our vision and tells the story.

We decided that an emotional piece of jewellery that connects two people when they are apart is the way to go and have been working on creating a versatile piece that is suitable for daily wear and long term use. It has been very challenging to create something beautiful, discrete and wearable.
